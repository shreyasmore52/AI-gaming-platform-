# AI-gaming-platform-

I've built a comprehensive AI gaming platform with three engaging games:

ðŸŽ® Features:

Tic-Tac-Toe - Classic 3x3 grid game against AI
Rock Paper Scissors - Quick-play against AI opponent
Number Guessing - Guess the AI's secret number (1-100)
Statistics Tracking - Wins, losses, and draws across all games
Responsive Design - Works on desktop and mobile
Modern UI - Glass-morphism design with smooth animations
ðŸ¤– AI Opponents:

Smart random moves for Tic-Tac-Toe
Random choice generation for Rock Paper Scissors
Dynamic feedback system for Number Guessing
The platform is now ready to run! Click the Run button to start playing. Each game has its own AI logic and the interface tracks your performance across all games.

## Running React 

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.tsx](#src/App.tsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)
